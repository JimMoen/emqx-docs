# Security Guide

Security is a critical aspect of any MQTT-based application, and this guide is designed to help you understand and implement robust security measures in your EMQX deployments. This chapter explores various security-related topics, focusing on access control and network security using Transport Layer Security (TLS). 

- [Access Control](./overview.md) introduces the related features, settings, and operations regarding authentication, authorization, and how to set up blacklists.
- [Networking and TLS](../network/overview.md) explain how EMQX supports end-to-end encrypted communication, including enabling SSL/TLS connections, PSK authentication, and obtaining SSL/TLS certificates.
