# TLS

This section primarily explores the concepts and functionalities of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and how to apply it to MQTT messaging systems.

TLS is an encryption protocol that ensures secure communication over networks, providing privacy, data integrity, and identity authentication. It establishes an encrypted connection between clients and servers, preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and unauthorized access.

To learn how the security of communication is ensured in EMQX, refer to [Network and TLS](../network/overview.md).
