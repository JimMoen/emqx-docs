# Incompatible Changes in EMQX 5.8

## e5.8.2

- [#14004](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14004) Fix an issue with Cluster Linking where having overlapping topic filters in `topics` configuration would lead to inconsistent and incomplete cross-cluster message routing. Each topic filter is respected now, but overlapping filters may lead to increased cross-cluster routing complexity.
  Redundant topic filters (e.g. `t/1` and `t/+`) in the `topics` configuration are now considered invalid. The link will fail to start if such configuration is detected.

- [#14015](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14015) Kafka/Confluent/Azure Event Hub Producers with a dynamic topic (i.e., a topic that contains placeholders) no longer support disk buffering.  Only memory and hybrid modes are now supported.

- [#14106](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14106) Added a validation that forbids a single Kafka Consumer connector from containing sources with repeated Kafka topics.  If you want to repeat topics, create new connector and source(s).


## e5.8.1

- [#13792](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13792) The default expiration time for a banned item that is created without an `until` value is now `infinity` (previsouly capped at 1 year limit).

- [#13742](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13742) Fixed an issue when a client would receive retained messages for a topic starting with `$` when it subscribed to topic `#` or `+`.

  This fix satisfies the requirement of [MQTT-4.7.2-1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901246).

## e5.8.0

- [#13080](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13080) Updated the default value of the `mqtt.retry_interval` configuration from 30 seconds to `infinity`.

  Previously, EMQX would automatically retry message deliveries every 30 seconds by default. With the new default set to `infinity`, EMQX will no longer retry message deliveries automatically. This change aligns with MQTT specification standards, which generally do not recommend in-session message delivery retries.

  We understand that some users rely on the retry feature, so the ability to configure a specific retry interval is still available for backward compatibility.

- [#13190](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13190) Discontinued support for releases on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 18. EMQX will no longer provide builds for these operating systems due to their end-of-life status.

- [#13248](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13248) Replaced the `builtin` durable storage backend with two new backends to provide better flexibility and scalability:

  - **`builtin_local`**: A durable storage backend that does not support replication, making it suitable for single-node deployments. This backend is available in both the open-source and enterprise editions of EMQX but is not compatible with multi-node clusters.
  - **`builtin_raft`**: A durable storage backend utilizing the Raft consensus algorithm for data replication across multiple nodes. This backend is exclusively available in the enterprise edition of EMQX, providing enhanced data durability and fault tolerance.

  Additionally, several Prometheus metrics have been renamed to better reflect their functions:

  - `emqx_ds_egress_batches` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_batches`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_batches_retry` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_batches_retry`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_batches_failed` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_batches_failed`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_messages` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_messages`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_bytes` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_bytes`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_flush_time` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_flush_time`

- [#13526](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13526) Removed the Core-replicant feature from the Open-Source Edition. Starting from release 5.8, all nodes running the Open-Source Edition will operate in the Core role. This change does not impact Enterprise Edition users, who will continue to have access to the Core-replicant functionality. Additionally, the obsolete `cluster.core_nodes` configuration parameter has been removed as it is no longer needed.

- [#13372](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13372) Now the number of connections accepted by gateways is governed by the licensing terms, ensuring compliance with the allowed connection limits.
