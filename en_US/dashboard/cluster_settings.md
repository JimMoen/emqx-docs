# Cluster Settings

EMQX provides hot configuration capabilities, which can dynamically modify the configuration at runtime without restarting the EMQX node. The EMQX Dashboard provides a visual configuration page for the hot configuration function, allowing you to easily modify the configuration of EMQX. The following configuration items are currently provided:

- MQTT Settings
- Listeners
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Cluster Linking

## MQTT Settings

Click **Management** -> **MQTT Settings** in the left menu to enter the MQTT protocol-related configuration page. In the MQTT Settings page, you can configure various MQTT-related parameters, including:

### General

The **General** tab page contains general basic configuration items for the MQTT protocol, such as idle timeout, maximum packet size, maximum client ID length, maximum topic levels, and maximum allowed QoS levels.

### Session

The **Session** tab page includes configuration items related to MQTT session management, such as session expiry interval (only supported for non-MQTT 5.0 connections; MQTT 5.0 connections need to be configured on the client side), maximum subscription count, maximum flight window, and whether to store QoS 0 messages.

### Durable Sessions

The **Durable Sessions** tab page includes configuration items related to the [MQTT Durable Sessions](../durability/durability_introduction.md) feature, such as message retention duration, message query batch size, idle poll interval, session heartbeat interval, etc.

### Retainer

The **Retainer** tab page contains MQTT protocol-related configuration items for retained messages, such as whether to enable retained messages, message storage type and method, maximum number of retained messages, retained message payload size, and message expiry interval. For more details, refer to [Configuring Retained Messages](./retained.md#retainer-settings).

> When retained messages are disabled, existing retained messages will not be deleted.

### System Topic

The **System Topic** tab page provides configuration items for EMQX's built-in system topics. EMQX periodically publishes operational status, usage statistics, and real-time client events to system topics prefixed with `$SYS/`. When clients subscribe to these topics, EMQX will publish related information to those topics. Configuration items for system topics include message publish interval, heartbeat interval, etc.

### Force Shutdown

The **Force Shutdown** tab allows you to configure the automatic shutdown behavior based on resource usage thresholds. This feature safeguards the EMQX from potential instability due to excessive resource consumption, such as message queue length or heap size.

You can configure settings for the following fields in the **Force Shutdown** tab page:

- **Enable Force Shutdown**: This toggle switch enables or disables the force shutdown feature. When enabled, the system will automatically trigger a shutdown if the specified resource thresholds are surpassed. It is enabled by default.
- **Max Heap Size**: Specifies the maximum allowed heap size for the system. If the heap size surpasses this limit, the system will initiate a forced shutdown to maintain stability. The default value is `32 MB`.
- **Max Message Queue Length**: Defines the maximum allowed length for the message queue. If the queue exceeds this length, a forced shutdown will be triggered to prevent system overload. The default value is `1000`.

## Listeners

Click on **Management** -> **Listeners** in the left menu to enter the listeners page. This page displays a list of listeners by default. EMQX provides four common listeners:

- TCP listener using port 1883
- SSL/TLS secure connection listener using port 8883
- WebSocket listener using port 8083
- WebSocket secure listener using port 8084

Typically, you can use these default listeners by specifying the corresponding port and protocol type. To add another type of listener, click the **+Add Listener** button in the top-right corner to create a new listener.

### Add Listener

In the **Add Lisenter** pop-up panel, you will see a form for adding a listener, which contains the basic configuration items. You can enter a name for the listener to identify it, choose the listener type (TCP, SSL, WS, WSS), and enter the listener address (IP address and port number). Using the IP address can restrict the listener's access range, or you can directly specify a port number.

#### Rate Limiting

In the **Limiter** section of the **Add Listener** form, you can limit the message receiving and publishing rates during EMQX operation, such as:

- Maximum Connection Rate (Listener)
- Maximum Message Publishing Rate (Per Client)
- Maximum Message Publishing Rraffic (Per Client)

Configuring rate limiting ensures the stability of the system and network when message data overload or excessive client requests occur.

For more detailed configuration on rate limiting, refer to [Rate Limit](../rate-limit/rate-limit.md).

For more details on listener configuration, refer to [EMQX Open Source Configuration Manual](https://docs.emqx.com/en/emqx/v@CE_VERSION@/hocon/) and  [EMQX Enterprise Configuration Manual](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/v@EE_VERSION@/hocon/).

### Manage Listeners

After adding a listener, you can see it in the list. Click on the listener's name to enter the editing page, where you can modify or delete the listener configuration. Note that the listener name, type, and listener address cannot be modified in the settings.

Click the **Delete** button in the editing page to remove the listener. When deleting a listener, you will need to enter the listener's name to confirm the deletion. You can also toggle the enable switch to enable or disable the listener. The list also shows the number of connections for each listener.

::: tip Warning

Modifying and deleting listeners is a risky operation and should be done carefully. If a listener is updated or deleted, client connections on that listener will be disconnected.

:::

## Logging

Click **Management** -> **Logging** in the left menu to enter the log configuration page. This page includes tabs for **Console Log**, **File Log**, **Log Throttling**, and **Audit Log**.

EMQX supports two types of log output: console log and file log. You can choose either or both types according to your needs. In the corresponding configuration page, you can enable or disable the log handler, set the log level, log format type, and for file logs, specify the log file path and log name. For more detailed configuration instructions on logs, refer to [Configure Logging via Dashboard](../observability/log.md#configure-logging-via-dashboard).

In the **Log Throttling** tab page, you can configure the time window for log throttling. For more information on log throttling, refer to [Log Rate Limiting](../observability/log.md#log-throttling).

In the **Audit Log** page, you can enable or disable the audit log feature in the EMQX Enterprise edition and configure it. For detailed configuration instructions, refer to [Audit Log](./audit-log.md).

## Monitoring

::: tip Note

The Monitoring feature is only available in the EMQX Enterprise edition.

:::

Click on **Management** -> **Monitoring** in the left menu to enter the monitoring integration configuration page. This page contains two tabs:

- **System**: Depending on the user's needs, the settings for the [Alarms](./diagnose.md#alarms) function, such as alarm thresholds, check intervals, etc., can be adjusted to a certain extent according to user needs.
- **Integration**: Provides configuration for integration with third-party monitoring platforms.

### System

If the default value of the current alarm trigger threshold or alarm monitoring check interval does not meet the actual needs, you can adjust the settings on this page. The current settings are divided into two modules: **Erlang VM** and **Operating System**, the default values and descriptions of each configuration item can be found in [Alarms](../observability/alarms.md).

### Integration

This page mainly provides integration configurations with third-party monitoring platforms. Currently, EMQX supports integration with **Prometheus**, **OpenTelemetry**, and **Datadog**.

When using the `Prometheus` third-party monitoring service, you can quickly enable the configuration on this page and set parameters such as the push data address and data reporting interval. You can directly use the API `/prometheus/stats` provided by EMQX to get monitoring data. When using this API, no authentication information is required. Please refer to [Prometheus](../observability/prometheus.md) for specific API.

In most cases, you do not need to use `Pushgateway` to monitor the metrics data of EMQX. And you can choose to configure a `Pushgateway` service address to push the monitoring data to `Pushgateway`, and then `Pushgateway` pushes the data to the `Prometheus` service. Click to view [When to use Pushgateway](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/).

On the bottom of the page, click the **Help** button, select the default or use the `Pushgateway` method, configure the address or API information of the relevant service according to the provided usage steps, and then quickly generate the corresponding `Prometheus` configuration file. Finally, use this configuration file to start the `Prometheus` service.

Users can customize and modify the monitoring data in `Grafana` according to their needs. After starting the `Prometheus` service, you can click the `Download Grafana Template` button at the end of the help page to download the configuration file of the default dashboard provided by us. Import the file into `Grafana`, and we can view the monitoring data of EMQX through the visualization panel. Users can also download the template from the [Grafana official website](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/17446-emqx/).

For detailed configuration of OpenTelemetry and Datadog integration, refer to [Integrate with OpenTelemetry](../observability/open-telemetry/open-telemetry.md) and [Integrate with Datadog](../observability/datadog.md).

## Cluster Linking

::: tip Note

The Cluster Linking feature is only available in the EMQX Enterprise edition.

:::

The Cluster Linking feature allows multiple independent EMQX clusters to be connected, enabling clients in geographically dispersed clusters to communicate with each other. Users can create and configure cluster links on this page. For detailed guidance on creation and configuration, refer to [EMQX Cluster Linking](../cluster-linking/introduction.md).
