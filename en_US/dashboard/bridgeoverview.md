# Data Integration

The Integration section on the Dashboard provides functions for creating rules, data integration with different data systems, schema validation, and message transformation. You can also perform the management operations such as editing the settings and viewing statistics for the functions. The sub-sections include the following:

- **Webhook**: For users who want to integrate with HTTP services but don't need to use rules for data processing, this page offers a simpler and more user-friendly creation and configuration experience. For detailed step-by-step guide, see [Webhook](../data-integration/webhook.md).
- **Flow Designer** (EMQX Enterprise feature): A powerful tool for visually viewing and managing the data processing and integration. For detailed introduction, see [Flow Designer](../flow-designer/introduction.md).
- [**Rules**](./rules.md): Provides all the functions about creating rules, testing rules, adding actions to the rules, and viewing rule execution statistics.
- **Connector**: As an indispensable component of the data integration, connectors are used to connect with external data systems. For how to create and manage connectors, see [Connector](../data-integration/connector.md).
- **Schema Validation** (EMQX Enterprise feature): Use validation rule to ensure that data to be published to specific topics must conform to predefined data formats. For how to create validation rules, see [Configure Schema Validation in Dashboard](../data-integration/schema-validation.md#configure-schema-validation-in-dashboard).
- **Schema** (EMQX Enterprise feature): You can create a schema to be used in the schema validation or SQL rules. For how to create a schema on Dashboard, see [Schema Registry Example - Avro](../data-integration/schema-registry-example-avro.md) or [Schema Registry Example - Protobuf](../data-integration/schema-registry-example-protobuf.md).
- **Message Transform**:
