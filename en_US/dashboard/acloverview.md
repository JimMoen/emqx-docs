# Access Control

Access control is used to set and manage client authentication and authorization rules and to prohibit access for certain clients. Expand the **Access Control** menu on the left-hand side to find the following submenus:

- **[Authentication](./authn.md)**: Create and configure authenticators, set authentication chains, view authentication performance metrics, and more.
- **[Authorization](./authz.md)**: Create and configure authorizers, set authorization chains, view authorization performance metrics, and manage authorization settings.
- **Banned Clients**: Prohibit access for certain clients by banning their client IDs. Refer to [Banned Clients](../access-control/blacklist.md) for details on creating and managing banned clients.
- **Flapping Detect**: Automatically ban clients detected as frequently logging in within a short period based on the banned clients. Learn how to enable and configure this feature on the Dashboard in [Flapping Detect](../access-control/flapping-detect.md).
