# EMQX Cluster Linking

Cluster Linking is a feature that allows bridging multiple separate EMQX clusters together, enabling communication between clients talking to different, potentially geographically distributed clusters. In contrast to the traditional MQTT bridging approaches, Cluster Linking is more efficient, reliable, and scalable: it minimizes the bandwidth requirements and tolerates network interruptions.
