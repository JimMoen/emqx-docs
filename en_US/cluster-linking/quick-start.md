# Quick Start with Cluster Linking

This page provides a quick start guide to set up the Cluster Linking between two distant EMQX clusters.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have compute resources in two different regions, each hosting an EMQX cluster. For this example, you can use `us-east` and `eu-west` regions, naming the clusters `cluster-us-east` and `cluster-eu-west`, respectively.

### Requirements

- EMQX version 5.8.0 or later
- Unique cluster names
- Network communication between clusters

Cluster Linking requires the MQTT listener of each cluster to be reachable from the other cluster's network. It is recommended to place these MQTT listeners behind a load balancer for even traffic distribution. For security, if using the public internet, ensure communication between clusters is secured using [TLS](./configuration.md) and strict [TLS or MQTT client authentication](../access-control/authn/authn.md).

## Set Up the First Cluster (cluster-us-east)

Set up the first cluster `cluster-us-east` using the following configuration snippet in the cluster's configuration file:

```bash
# Cluster Linking configuration
cluster {
  # This cluster's name
  name = "cluster-us-east"
  links = [
    {
      # Name of the second cluster
      name = "cluster-eu-west"
      # Endpoint of the second cluster's MQTT listener
      server = "emqx.us-east.myinfra.net:11883"
      clientid = "clink-us-east"
      topics = ["#"]
    }
  ]
}

# Dedicated listener for Cluster Linking connections
listeners {
  tcp.clink {
    bind = 11883
  }
}
```

This configuration specifies the following:
- The remote cluster is named `cluster-eu-west`.
- The cluster can be accessed at `emqx.us-east.myinfra.net:11883`.
- The Client ID prefix for Cluster Linking MQTT connections is `clink-us-east`.
- All messages (matching the `#` wildcard topic) will be forwarded to the local cluster.
- A dedicated listener for Cluster Linking connections is enabled on port 11883.

## Set Up the Second Cluster (cluster-eu-west)

Set up the second cluster `cluster-eu-west` using the following configuration snippet in the cluster's configuration file:
```bash
# Cluster Linking configuration
cluster {
  name = "cluster-eu-west"
  links = [
    {
      name = "cluster-us-east"
      server = "emqx.eu-west.myinfra.net:11883"
      clientid = "clink-eu-west"
      topics = ["#"]
    }
  ]
}

# Dedicated listener for Cluster Linking connections
listeners {
  tcp.clink {
    bind = 11883
  }
}
```

This configuration is symmetrical to that of the first cluster. With both configurations in place, a symmetrical, bidirectional Cluster Link will be established between the two clusters once they are up and running. It is also possible to create _asymmetrical_ links, which will be covered later.

## Verify Cluster Linking

To confirm that clients connected to different clusters can now communicate using standard MQTT mechanisms, you can use the [MQTTX CLI](https://mqttx.app/cli) tool to publish messages from one cluster and subscribe to them from the other.

1. Start a subscriber on `cluster-us-east`:

   ```bash
   mqttx sub -h emqx.us-east.myinfra.net --topic linked/# --qos 1 --verbose
   [6/4/2024] [3:53:32 PM] › …  Connecting...
   [6/4/2024] [3:53:32 PM] › ✔  Connected
   [6/4/2024] [3:53:32 PM] › …  Subscribing to linked/#...
   [6/4/2024] [3:53:32 PM] › ✔  Subscribed to linked/#
   ```

2. Publish a message from `cluster-eu-west`:

   ```bash
   mqttx pub -h emqx.eu-west.myinfra.net --topic linked/42 --message "Hello from the other side!"
   [6/4/2024] [3:53:35 PM] › …  Connecting...
   [6/4/2024] [3:53:35 PM] › ✔  Connected
   [6/4/2024] [3:53:35 PM] › …  Message publishing...
   [6/4/2024] [3:53:35 PM] › ✔  Message published
   ```

3. Observe that the message is received by the subscriber:

   ```bash
   [6/4/2024] [3:53:35 PM] › topic: linked/42
   payload: Hello from the other side!
   ```

4. Repeat the process in the opposite direction:

   - Start a subscriber on `cluster-eu-west`:

     ```bash
     mqttx sub -h emqx.eu-west.myinfra.net --topic linked/# --qos 1 --verbose
     [6/4/2024] [3:54:12 PM] › …  Connecting...
     [6/4/2024] [3:54:12 PM] › ✔  Connected
     [6/4/2024] [3:54:12 PM] › …  Subscribing to linked/#...
     [6/4/2024] [3:54:12 PM] › ✔  Subscribed to linked/#
     ```

   - Publish a message from `cluster-us-east`:

     ```bash
     mqttx pub -h emqx.us-east.myinfra.net --topic linked/1 --message "Hello from US!"
     [6/4/2024] [3:54:15 PM] › …  Connecting...
     [6/4/2024] [3:54:15 PM] › ✔  Connected
     [6/4/2024] [3:54:15 PM] › …  Message publishing...
     [6/4/2024] [3:54:15 PM] › ✔  Message published
     ```

   - Observe that the message is received by the subscriber:

     ```bash
     [6/4/2024] [3:54:15 PM] › topic: linked/1
     payload: Hello from US!
     ```

Perfect! The Cluster Linking is working.

::: tip

Cluster Linking involves the propagation of subscription information between clusters, which is an asynchronous process. This typically takes only a few milliseconds, but it may cause a slight delay in message delivery if you publish a message immediately after subscribing.

:::

## Set Up Asymmetrical Links

To create an asymmetrical link, you need to slightly modify the `cluster-eu-west` configuration:

```bash
cluster {
  name = "cluster-eu-west"
  links = [
    {
      name = "cluster-us-east"
      server = "emqx.eu-west.myinfra.net:11883"
      clientid = "clink-eu-west"
      topics = []
    }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the configuration is almost identical to the previous one, except the `topics` field is empty. This means that `cluster-eu-west` is now not interested in _any_ messages from `cluster-us-east`. This makes the Cluster Link _asymmetrical_, which is useful for one-way message forwarding between clusters.

If you repeat the message publishing and subscribing steps outlined above, you will notice that the message published from `cluster-us-east` is not received by the subscriber on `cluster-eu-west`.
